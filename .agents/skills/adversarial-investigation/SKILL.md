name: adversarial-investigation
argument-hint: describe the production problem, symptoms, and what has been tried
description: |
  Spawns a 4-5 agent adversarial investigation team (Lead, Code-Analyst, Telemetry-Analyst,
  Explorer, Devil's Advocate) to diagnose complex production problems through parallel
  investigation and consensus-driven root cause analysis.
  Use when user asks to "run adversarial investigation", "investigate with team",
  "deep dive production issue", "root cause with agents", "adversarial debug",
  "multi-agent investigation", or needs multi-path cross-validated diagnosis
  that single-agent investigation can't provide.
  Do NOT use for straightforward log triage, single-component debugging,
  or CI failure diagnosis — use simpler single-agent investigation for those.

# Adversarial Investigation Team

5 agents: 4 mandatory (Lead, Code-Analyst, Explorer, Devil's Advocate) + Telemetry-Analyst (mandatory when production is involved, optional for pure code/design with no runtime component and no telemetry claims). Unanimous consensus on: scope, root cause, and fix.

## Problem

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Evidence Standard

Every agent prompt includes this standard. Every claim requires a receipt:

| Agent | Valid Receipt Types |
|-------|-------------------|
| Code-Analyst | `file:line` of executable code (NOT comments/docs) |
| Telemetry-Analyst | Query result with raw numbers, log lines, timestamps |
| Explorer | Issue number, PR number, commit SHA, doc path |
| Devil's Advocate | Any of the above (demands receipts from others) |

No receipt = claim excluded on submission. Unreceipted observations go in ASSUMPTIONS, not evidence.
**Hierarchy:** Tool output > code paths > artifacts. Comments, docstrings, docs, agent reasoning are NEVER evidence.
**Code ≠ production:** Code proves what CAN happen. Telemetry proves what DID happen. NEVER substitute.
**User experience is fact:** Users can be wrong about mechanism, NEVER about their experience. Findings contradicting symptoms → reopen scope.
**Absence ≠ evidence:** "Not found" means search was incomplete, not that it doesn't exist.
**Discrimination:** Before searching for a hypothesis, predict what you would find if TRUE vs FALSE. After evidence FOR, run 2+ searches targeting the FALSE prediction. Counter-searches must vary source (code vs telemetry vs history) or query strategy (different keywords, different entry points, different time windows). List all searches and results.
**Verification:** Verify claims via tool calls, not self-review. Re-reading your own reasoning is not verification.
**Hazards:** (1) Inherited certainty — problem statement is hypothesis, not axiom. (2) Confirmation bias — no disconfirming evidence? Search for refutation. (3) Hasty commitment — one data point ≠ root cause, test an alternative.
**Convergence:** Independent paths reaching the same conclusion raises confidence. Divergence must be investigated, not resolved by majority.

## Agents

**Lead Investigator:**
- "You are the Lead Investigator. You drive convergence — independent minds toward a single truth. If you filter, frame, or omit, every downstream conclusion is compromised."
- Lead produces ONLY structured outputs per protocol templates. No free-form analysis. No interpretation of evidence. No hypothesis formation.
- NEVER reads code, runs queries, or forms hypotheses. Coordinates logistics, not epistemics.
- **Scoreboard** (externalized after every round):

  | Track | States |
  |-------|--------|
  | Symptoms (verbatim) | `unexplained` → `covered` (agent + receipt) |
  | Hypotheses (flat list) | `alive` → `dead`+receipt / `parked`+receipt+DA approval |
  | Info gaps (owner, scope) | `open` → `closed` / `escalated` |

  **Gate check:** ALL symptoms covered, ALL gaps closed, ALL 3 Evidence-Completeness Gates pass → proceed to consensus.
- **Anti-patterns:** Circular → require new evidence. Position change → "what NEW evidence?" Ranking or filtering agent findings → protocol violation.
- Escalates to human with exactly what is unresolved.

**Code-Analyst:**
- "You are the Code-Analyst. You trace what code does, not what anyone says it does. If a relevant code path exists and you didn't find it, the investigation builds on incomplete evidence."
- **Landscape:** Map every code path relevant to the problem. Inventory: entry points, data flows, error handlers, edge cases, configuration. Hypotheses emerge from evidence.
- When someone says "it can't be X": "show me the code path that makes X impossible."
- Trace data flow end-to-end, hop by hop. After forming a hypothesis, re-read each critical function: "Does this handle [hypothesis-relevant condition]?"
- After every finding: "where else does this pattern exist?" — search the full codebase.

**Telemetry-Analyst:**
- "You are the Telemetry-Analyst. You have sole access to what actually happened in production. If production evidence exists and you didn't surface it, the investigation lacks ground truth."
- **First:** Read investigate-runtime and investigate-orchestrator skills from Knowledge Map for cluster URLs, table schemas, query patterns.
- **Landscape:** Survey all telemetry for the problem time window. Inventory: chronological event chain (deployment/config changes, first symptom, error inflections — all with timestamps), error rates, anomalies, state transitions. Hypotheses emerge from data.
- Post-fix validation (when deployed): verifies target metric improves and adjacent metrics unchanged.

**Explorer:**
- "You are the Explorer — the team's memory. If a prior investigation or fix exists and you didn't find it, the team reinvents a failed approach."
- **Landscape:** Build history inventory. Search issues and PRs FIRST (including closed) — 10+ keyword variations. Inventory: deployments, merges, dependency updates in 72h before first symptom (via commits, PRs, release tags), prior investigations, related fixes, regression history, design decisions. No prior art found? State explicitly — absence of history = novel problem class.
- First report must answer: "Has this been investigated before? Is there an existing fix? Could this be a regression?"
- When team converges: search for related regressions, adjacent subsystem impacts, prior failed fixes for the same root cause.

**Devil's Advocate (DA):**
- "You are the Devil's Advocate. Your job is to ensure the investigation is complete AND to kill weak conclusions. If you fail to challenge a weak claim, you are the last line of defense and the investigation ships a wrong answer. Politeness is not a factor."
- Operates across all lanes — challenges evidence from any agent.
- **Four duties:** (1) Coverage — was every domain checked per hypothesis? (2) Receipt — does each receipt support its claim? (3) Scope — was anything narrowed without justification? (4) Alternative — what fits confirmed evidence but wasn't explored? If an alternative survives, consensus fails.
- Each challenge MUST specify the **required receipt type** to resolve it (`file:line`, `query result`, `commit/PR/issue`). This determines which agent owns the response. Lead returns challenges missing a receipt type tag.
- A challenge REFUTED with strong evidence improved confidence — that is DA success. Quality = investigation value, not survival rate.
- **R1 (independent):** NEVER receives other agents' findings. Own landscape mapping. Challenges problem definition + scope. Deliverable: 2+ alternative explanations derived from own landscape. Assume the problem statement's implied causation is wrong — what else produces these symptoms? 5-Whys: is this the right problem or a symptom?
- **R2 (adversarial):** Receives all R1 reports. Runs four duties. Extracts assumptions from each report: "verified with a tool or inferred?" Audits Lead's digest for omissions against raw reports.
- **R3 (completeness):** Verifies Evidence-Completeness Gates. Signs off or identifies gaps. Consensus CANNOT proceed without DA sign-off.
- **Stress test:** Generates 1 NEW hypothesis (not previously proposed) contradicting consensus that fits all confirmed evidence. No refutation → escalate. Challenges fix: root cause or masking?
- When satisfied: "I accept [X] because [evidence]. I still challenge [Y]."

## Knowledge Map

Every agent prompt MUST include this map. Sub-agents start fresh — zero inherited context.

```
## KNOWLEDGE MAP — Read what you need for your role

Architecture & conventions:
- Repo context:             ./AGENTS.md (workspace layout, components, quality gates, MCP servers, git ops)
- Component-level docs:     ./<component>/AGENTS.md or ./<component>/CLAUDE.md (if present)
- Architecture docs:        Glob **/docs/ARCHITECTURE*.md
- Design docs:              Glob **/docs/design/*.md — Grep pattern="<keyword>" to find relevant ones
- API & protocol specs:     Glob **/docs/*API*.md, **/*.proto, and any project-specific protocol docs

Telemetry & production observability (Telemetry-Analyst reads BEFORE querying):
- ./AGENTS.md → "Telemetry & Observability" section — authoritative source for telemetry system,
  cluster URLs, table / namespace names, filters, correlation conventions, and noise patterns for this repo.
- Any project-specific investigation skills (Glob .agents/skills/investigate-*/SKILL.md) extend the basics.

Cross-component correlation:
- ./AGENTS.md → "Telemetry & Observability" → correlation IDs / trace-id / CV conventions section.

MCP & tooling bootstrapping:
- MCP config:               ./.mcp.json (if present — cluster URLs, auth, server commands)
- ./AGENTS.md → "MCP Servers" section lists what's configured and how each is used.

CI/CD pipelines:
- ./AGENTS.md → "PR Quality Checklist" section — required checks and how to invoke them.
- Pipeline definitions:     Glob .github/workflows/**/*.yml or .pipelines/**/*.yml

Skills (agents can read but NOT invoke):
- All skills:               Glob .agents/skills/*/SKILL.md, .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md

Past investigations and project memory:
- Memory notes / reports:   Glob .memories/**/*.md (if the project keeps a memory directory)
- Issues (all states):      gh issue list --state all --search "<keywords>"
- PRs (all states):         gh pr list --state all --search "<keywords>"
- Commits by keyword:       git log --oneline --grep="<keyword>" -20
- Recent changes to file:   git log --oneline -10 <file>
```

If `AGENTS.md` has no "Telemetry & Observability" section yet, the Telemetry-Analyst cannot contribute — proceed with 4 agents instead of 5 (see "5 agents" note at the top — Telemetry-Analyst is optional for pure code/design problems with no runtime component).

## Protocol

### Round 1: Landscape Mapping
1. **Lead input:** Verbatim problem statement + user-reported symptoms. No assumptions, no framing, no scope direction.
2. **Lead spawns all agents in parallel** as `general-purpose` subagent_type. Every prompt: problem statement, symptoms, Evidence Standard, Knowledge Map, lane definition.
3. **Each agent maps their domain independently.** For each finding: receipt, causal relationship to problem, and 1+ counter-search. Breadth limited to problem-relevant items. Omissions acceptable if SCOPE explains.
4. **Report structure** (Lead sends back non-compliant reports):
   - **Domain inventory:** What exists in this lane relevant to the problem
   - **Emergent hypotheses:** What the evidence suggests (with receipts)
   - **Evidence FOR and AGAINST** each hypothesis (receipts, counter-searches listed)
   - **Problem-statement verification:** Verify or contradict claims relevant to your lane
   - **SCOPE:** "Searched [list]. Did NOT search [list + reason]."
   - **ASSUMPTIONS:** `ASSUMED: [claim] — [why unverified]` per unverified claim

### Evidence Digest (between every round)
Lead compiles from agent reports — structured template, no free-form analysis:
- Confirmed findings with raw evidence (log lines, file:line, query results — not summaries)
- Hypotheses: flat list (alive / dead+kill receipt / parked)
- Symptom map: each symptom → finding+receipt or `UNEXPLAINED`
- System check: architecture/design issue rather than local bug? Answer with evidence or add as hypothesis.
- Reframing: did any landscape suggest a different problem? → add as hypothesis
- Scoreboard state (all agents see it for self-correction)
- Follow-up questions (derived from agent-identified gaps only)

**DA audits the digest** during R2. Compares against raw reports. Omissions corrected in next digest.
DA receives full prior-round reports for audit. Other agents receive compressed digest (one-line fact + receipt pointer per finding).
**Cross-lane:** When a finding needs cross-domain verification, Lead bridges with raw evidence attached (not just receipt pointers): "Code-Analyst found X [full evidence] — Telemetry: query for X's production signature."

### Round 2: Adversarial Review
Lead spawns all agents with Evidence Digest + role-specific tasks:

| Agent | R2 Task |
|-------|---------|
| **DA** | All R1 reports. Four duties. Digest audit. Each challenge includes acceptance criteria. |
| **Code-Analyst** | Cross-lane verification + DA challenges requiring code investigation. |
| **Telemetry-Analyst** | Cross-lane verification + DA challenges requiring production evidence. |
| **Explorer** | Blast radius, regression checks, prior art for DA's alternatives. |

R2 is scoped: agents answer R1 gaps and DA challenges, not re-investigate from scratch.

### Round 3: Resolution
Lead spawns all agents with R2 Digest. Each agent resolves their lane's DA challenges and gaps.

**R3 exit → verdict or escalate:**
1. Every DA challenge from R2 and R3 has a disposition (per §Disposition)
2. All 3 Evidence-Completeness Gates pass (per §Consensus)
→ All pass: stress test then verdict. **Any fail: ESCALATE to human with specific failing criteria.**
When escalating: distinguish SATURATED (evidence exhausted) from BLOCKED (evidence unreachable — specify what and why).

### Disposition Protocol
DA challenges are ELEVATED. For each, Lead produces ONE disposition with a receipt:

| Disposition | When | Evidence | DA Sign-off |
|-------------|------|----------|-------------|
| **REFUTED** | Alternative ruled out | Receipt contradicting it | No |
| **ABSORBED** | Compatible with verdict | Receipt showing compatibility | **Yes — DA must agree** |
| **PROMOTED** | Not refuted | Elevate to hypothesis for R3 | No |
| **ESCALATED** | Unresolvable | What evidence is missing | No |

**SCOPE challenges cannot be ABSORBED.** Scope was legitimately narrowed (REFUTED) or wasn't (PROMOTED).
Each challenge MUST include acceptance criteria. Without criteria → UNFALSIFIABLE, cannot block consensus.
**Classes:** SCOPE (narrowing without justification) · EVIDENCE (receipt doesn't support claim) · ALTERNATIVE (unexplored explanation fits evidence).

## Consensus
Unanimous agreement on scope, root cause, fix. One dissent = investigate. DA dissent elevated per §Disposition.

**Evidence-Completeness Gates (all 3 MUST pass):**
1. **Symptom coverage:** Every symptom covered by 2+ independent evidence-producing agents. When Telemetry-Analyst is absent, symptoms coverable by only 1 agent → ESCALATE. No `UNEXPLAINED`.
2. **Discriminating evidence:** Per surviving hypothesis, evidence distinguishes from alternatives — not just compatible.
3. **DA sign-off:** Four duties satisfied. No unresolved gaps.

**Stress test (after gates pass):** Revive parked/dead hypotheses by receipt ("what rules this out?"). DA generates 1 contradicting hypothesis. Every hypothesis needs a disproof test (unfalsifiable = cannot be root cause). Any failure → escalate.

**Verdict** (all fields required, confidence ≥75 = CONFIRMED, 50-74 = PRELIMINARY, <50 = INCONCLUSIVE):
1. **Root Cause** — one sentence. INCONCLUSIVE: top hypotheses + what discriminating evidence is needed.
2. **Confidence** — 0-100 + justification (how many agents converged, via what independent paths).
3. **Evidence Chain** — ≥3 hops: symptom → proximate → root. Each hop: fact receipt + causal receipt.
4. **Symptom Coverage** — per symptom: covering agents, finding, receipt.
5. **Blast Radius** — affected components, code paths, teams.
6. **Fix** — mapped to evidence chain hop. Symptom-only = "mitigation." Regression risk + test coverage.
7. **Gates + Stress Test** — pass/fail per gate. DA contradiction hypothesis + result.
8. **DA Disposition Log** — per challenge: class, criteria, disposition, sign-off, evidence.
9. **Dissent** — unresolved disagreements + what evidence resolves them. Or: "Unanimous."

## Constraints
1. All agents: `general-purpose` subagent_type (MCP + Bash required).
2. Every agent prompt includes Evidence Standard + Knowledge Map.
3. Exactly 3 rounds. R3 gate failure → escalate to human. No additional rounds.
4. One role per subagent. Combined agents lose adversarial independence.
5. Single problem scope. Multiple symptoms may share root cause; unrelated problems = separate invocations.
6. R1: Agents investigate within their designated lane only. R2/R3: Cross-lane evidence provided only when assigned by Lead via digest.
7. No spawning outside round structure. No ad-hoc investigation.
8. Every factual assertion MUST attach a receipt. No exceptions.
9. Conclusions require discriminating evidence — must rule out alternatives, not just be compatible.
10. All surviving hypotheses receive equal investigation effort. Flat list is a behavioral mandate, not a formatting suggestion.
11. Fix MUST map to evidence chain hop. Symptom-only fix = "mitigation."
